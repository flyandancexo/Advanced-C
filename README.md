C is my favorite programming language because it is so powerful and so complicated in a way that allows me to communicate my brain to the lowest level of a digital logic gate, yet it can be implemented as a high level programming, but with greatest difficulty and obscurity. Understanding the language itself will get you nowhere. One needs to fully understand the platform it's written for, and that is 100+ times harder than the C programming language itself, so most dummies avoid C because C requires more brain power and more problem solving skill from a programmer, and while a program written by C is the highest quality, it also requires the longest time. In today's quantity-over-quality world, C has zero chance to compete, but it still works and is still widely used due to the fact that older programs were written using C.  

My 100 high quality C examples, as expertly written as I humanly and humbly possible, will redefine what C is all about, but to fully appreciate what C can do, you absolutely need to understand assembly and the CPU architecture of your targeted platform. A lot of the programming concept originates from assembly language, and the assembly language is created in a way that makes it possible to control the lowest level of the digital logic that we call a computer. 

This is a long and complicated endeavor, so any support is very welcomed. Do donate whatever amount that you are comfortable with.
